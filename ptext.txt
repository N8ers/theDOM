line 1 - First thing's first we gotta make a variable. 
Since we are making it, you can name this whatever you want! 
In this case we're going to go with 'btnClick'.
<br>

line 2 - Then we're going to a querySelector to assign our new variable, 
in this case we're assigning it to the id "#btnClick" - 
it's important to note that in our HTML the button also has this same id
Since we are working with an id, don't forget the octothorp. 
If we were using the querySelector to assign a class then we would us a period in stead of an octothorp.
Next we're going to add an event listner to that variable!

line 3 - An event listener is a method that calls a function when a specific event occurs.
So in this case we want to add the method to our new variable "btnClick".
the addEventListener method will take two arguments. 
The first is the specific event type (in this case 'click' here is a list of all 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events" target="_blank">event types<a/>. 
The second is the listener, in this case it will be another function.
<br>

line 4 - This function is going to change the color of the body's background. 
The line "document.body.style.background" looks a little funky.
It's basically saying with in the document, select body 
- within the body, select the style attributes 
- with in the style attributes, select background
It's using javascript to manipulate the css through the DOM to change the body's color.

line 5 - this line "randoColor();" - is calling a function I made that produces a random color. 
For your practice though you could just replace that function with a nice shade of green!

<p> problems i ran into that you might too 
	I just wanted to make a button that changed the color of something else in the document! 
    That came with about 4 hours of relearning the basics of the DOM.
    Here are some silly things that I forgot about that you might want to keep in mind.

the period/otcothorp inside the querySelector: 
    This is line 2, making sure that the document knows wether it needs to recognize a class or an id.
understanding the syntax:
    when trying to manipulate a specific part of the document, 
    you need to go through the document selection process. 
    In this example we used 'document.body.style.background',
    but here is a link with more on the topic of
