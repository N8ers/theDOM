First thing is first we gotta make a variable. 
Remember you can name this whatever you want! 
Then we're going to a querySelector to assign our new variable, 
in this case we're assigning it to the id "btnClick" - 
if it's an id DON'T forget your octothorp. 
if it's a class don't forget the period then we're going to add an event listner to that variable! 
we then have two arguments to fill out. the first is the action that will activate the listener. 
The secont is what we want it to do. In this case we want the click action to activate a function! 
This function is going to change the color of the body's background. 
The line "document.body.style.background" looks a little funky, 
it's using javascript to manipulate the css through the D.O.M. to change the body's color. 
the next line "randoColor();" - is calling a function I made that produces a random color. 
for your practice though you could just replace that function with a nice shade of green!
